# comf-admin-bot

An admin bot for my friend group 'comfort zone' server. 

It will have pretty much just whatever features we need or I feel like adding. It's
primary purpose is to manage invites and the reaction-role system, so anything else
is bonus.

## Development

Bot token goes in `token.txt` in root of the repository, or next to jar file after
exported. Run `./gradlew build` to get started on the project, and `./gradlew jar`
to export fat jar for deployment.
